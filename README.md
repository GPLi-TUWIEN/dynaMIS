## Overview

This is the open source project DynaMIS-a dynamic maximum independent solver by TUWIEN. The independent set problem is a fundamental graph problem with a wide range of applications. Given a graph $G = (V, E)$, a set of vertices $M \subset V$ is independent if no two vertices in $M$ are adjacent in G. A maximal independent set (MIS) is an independent set that
is not a proper subset of any other independent set. A maximum independent set (Max-IS)
is a maximum cardinality independent set. While Max-IS is one of Karp’s 21 classic NP56 complete problems [31], computing a MIS can easily be done by a simple greedy algorithm in
$O(|E|)$ time. The MIS problem has been studied in the context of several other prominent
problems, e.g., graph coloring [33], maximum matching [30], and vertex cover [36]. On the
other hand, Max-IS serves as a natural model for many real-life optimization problems,
including map labeling [3], computer vision [6], information retrieval [37], and scheduling [38].
